Based on the information provided, I need to clarify that there was a misunderstanding in the AI's response. The AI didn't actually provide any code changes for `src/pages/Index.tsx`. Instead, it mentioned that the file is read-only and suggested using the existing navigation flow through Dashboard to access the History page.

Since no actual code changes were proposed for `src/pages/Index.tsx`, I cannot provide a full code replacement. The AI's suggestion was to use the existing navigation:
1. Navigate from Index to Dashboard
2. Use the BottomNavigation component in Dashboard to access History

If you want to modify `src/pages/Index.tsx` to add direct navigation to the History page, you would need to create that implementation yourself or request a specific modification to the Index page.
